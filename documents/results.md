Description:
  A written report. 
  In addition to your code, your Github repository must contain a results.md file which describes:

  The output and correctness of each algorithm – You should summarize, visualize, or highlight some part of the full-scale run of each algorithm. 
  Additionally, the report should briefly describe what tests you performed to confirm that each algorithm was working as intended.

  The answer to your leading question – You should direct address your proposed leading question. 
    How did you answer this question? 
    What did you discover? 
    If your project was ultimately unsuccessful, give a brief reflection about what worked and what you would do differently as a team.
  
  
 Requirement:
   "All project goals are met and:
    There are clear descriptions, figures, or tables of each method's output on the full target dataset. 
    (Note: Figures can be stored as plain images in your git repo and the link provided in the .md)
    There is a written discussion of the projects findings that makes and proves a claim that each method was successful."
