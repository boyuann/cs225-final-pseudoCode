## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    - Work distribution will be based on each members' strength and their workload on the other courses each week. If some members has exams or has more homework to do on the other courses, they can report their situations on the weekly meetings so that we can redistribute the work. 
     
     - If members encounters a setback, unexpected complications or unforeseen work, they shoudl report it on time either online or offline. If there is no meeting scheduled around that time we will hold a quick meeting to deal with it. 
     
     - We will post the weekly tasks on Discord. Group members are required to choose the tasks they are interested in. Tasks remained on the Discord for more than two days will be randomly distributed to the members with fewer tasks if they have no special situation on that week.
