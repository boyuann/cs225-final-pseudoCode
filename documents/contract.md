## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
     - Work distribution will be based on each members' strength and their workload on the other courses each week. If some members has exams or has more homework to do on the other courses, they can report their situations on the weekly meetings so that we can redistribute the work. 
     
     - If members encounters a setback, unexpected complications or unforeseen work, they shoudl report it on time either online or offline. If there is no meeting scheduled around that time we will hold a quick meeting to deal with it. 
     
     - We will post the weekly tasks on Discord. Group members are required to choose the tasks they are interested in. Tasks remained on the Discord for more than two days will be randomly distributed to the members with fewer tasks if they have no special situation on that week. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
    - Each teammate should have 8 Â± 5 hourss/week for tasks
    - If someone unable to finsh the task,(exams, ills, family issues..) they need to notify their team members in advance, so there will give team space to reassign the task to make sure the whole progress can be finished on time.
    - If someone deliberately does not complete a task, we will REPORT that person.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    - If members have different opinions about our projects, we have additional discussions to make sure everyone is on the same track about moving the project forward, because we respect everyone's opinion.We ask our staff for help and advice if it' s necessary
    
    - We will always check everyone's completion status two days before the deadline in order to address unexpected issues or if there are groups that are too slow. This is to ensure that no group member will be left without completing the task by the deadline
    
    - If the team is late or wants to discuss the situation in advance, we can always use WeChat, Discord to discuss and give timely feedback to ensure that no group member will lose the message or cannot keep up with the progress in time
